  The Soil and Water Assessment Tool Plus (SWAT+) is a public domain
  model jointly developed by the USDA Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS),
  Texas A&M AgriLife Research(part of The Texas A&M University System),
  Colorado State University, USDA-ARS Hydrology and Remote Sensing Laboratory,
  and other entities. SWAT+ is a small watershed to river basin-scale model used
  to simulate the quality and quantity of surface and ground water and predict 
  the environmental impact of land use, land management practices, and climate change.
  SWAT is widely used in assessing soil erosion prevention and control,
  non-point source pollution control and regional management in watersheds.
